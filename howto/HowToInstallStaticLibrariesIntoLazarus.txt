To install a static library - (Framework) into Lazarus for IOS 

must copy the SDK into the directories for both the simulator and the real device:

there is a script in the scripts directory for showing them - on my installation right now mine are

Simulator:
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator?.?.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks

Real device:
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS?.?.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks

for you to find these yourself - use this script

./scripts/ShowSDKPaths.sh
